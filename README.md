# 100 Days of SwiftUI - Paul Hudson

This repository contains my progress and code solutions for Paul Hudson's [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course.

## About the Course

The 100 Days of SwiftUI is a comprehensive course designed to teach you SwiftUI from scratch. It covers a wide range of topics, including:

* Swift fundamentals.
* SwiftUI layout and design principles.
* Working with various SwiftUI views and modifiers.
* Animations and transitions.
* Working with data.
* Networking and data fetching.
* Training machine learning model with CreateML and integration with SwiftUI.
* Combine framework for reactive programming.
* Data management using `@State`, `@Binding`, `@ObservedObject`/`@Observable`, and `@EnvironmentObject`.
* UserDefaults, Core Data, SwiftData for persistent storage.
* Working with maps, sensors, and other device capabilities.
* Architectural Patterns and Best Practices.
* Advanced SwiftUI concepts and best practices.
* And much more!

## Notes

*  Each project directory contains the final/completed project for the particular module named the Project name itself.
*  Some Project directories contain previous project directories in them, these are the completed challenges or features applied to them for the topics taught in the 
   current project. 
*  Solutions to the current project challenges are commented next to project code.
